#Data Structures
### 1. Data Initialization: The code initializes variables containing information about teams, players, scores, dates, and odds.
### 2. Manipulating Data Structures: Arrays and objects are used to store and manipulate various data related to teams, players, scores, and odds.
### 3. Functions and Operations: Functions are defined to perform actions such as ordering food, printing goals, and determining the team more likely to win based on odds. Operators like logical assignment operators, nullish coalescing operator, and logical short-circuiting operators are utilized.
### 4. Iteration and Looping: Loops and iteration are used to iterate over arrays and objects, printing information, calculating averages, and generating output.
### 5. String Manipulation and Formatting: String methods and techniques are employed to manipulate and format strings, such as splitting, joining, padding, replacing, and transforming case.
### 6. Additional Concepts: Concepts like destructuring arrays and objects, using the spread operator, and optional chaining are utilized to extract and manipulate data efficiently.

## The code covers a range of topics including data structures, loops, functions, string manipulation, and various JavaScript operators. It demonstrates how these concepts can be applied in the context of a football betting app
